# NXAPI Exercise 1

1. Create an `nxapi_plumbing` "Device" object for nxos1. The api_format should be "jsonrpc" and the transport should be "https" (port 8443). Use getpass() to capture the device's password. Send the "show interface Ethernet1/1" command to the device, parse the output, and print out the following information:

```
Interface: Ethernet1/1; State: up; MTU: 1500
```
